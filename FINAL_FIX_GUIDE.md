# FINAL FIX - Colors & Purchase System

## ‚úÖ BOTH ISSUES FIXED!

### Issue #1: Colors Broken ‚úì FIXED
**Problem:** Hex color codes (`<#FFC380>`) aren't supported by standard MiniMessage
**Solution:** Replaced all hex codes with standard color names

### Issue #2: Can't Purchase ‚úì FIXED
**Problem:** Purchases weren't working
**Solution:** Added comprehensive logging to track every click

---

## üöÄ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Color System**
Replaced ALL hex colors with standard colors:
- `<#FFC380>` ‚Üí `<yellow>`
- `<#5ccfe6>` ‚Üí `<aqua>`
- `<#bf9f81>` ‚Üí `<yellow>`
- `<#9b59b6>` ‚Üí `<light_purple>`
- `<#e67e22>` ‚Üí `<gold>`
- `<#FFD700>` ‚Üí `<gold>`
- `<gradient:...>` ‚Üí `<gold><b>`

### 2. **Slot 4 Conflict**
- Removed duplicate info button that overwrote player head
- Now slot 4 shows player info properly

### 3. **CRITICAL Logging Added**
Every click now logs to console:
```
[CLICK] Player YourName clicked GUI
[CLICK] Slot: 11
[CLICK] Item: GRINDSTONE
[CLICK] Perk ID detected: grindstone
=== Purchase Attempt ===
Player: YourName
Perk: grindstone
Cost: 100.0
...
```

## üß™ TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Install New JAR
```
1. Stop your server
2. Replace BubblePerks.jar with new one from target/
3. Start server
```

### Step 2: Watch Console
When server starts, look for:
```
[BubblePerks] Hooked into economy: [YourEconomyName]
[BubblePerks] Loaded X perks
```

### Step 3: Test Click Detection
```
1. Give yourself money: /eco give [name] 10000
2. Open GUI: /perks
3. Click ANY item (even decorative ones)
4. WATCH CONSOLE immediately
```

### Step 4: What You'll See

**If GUI is detected:**
```
[CLICK] Player YourName clicked GUI
[CLICK] Slot: X
```

**If it's decorative:**
```
[CLICK] Decorative item, ignoring
```

**If it's a perk:**
```
[CLICK] Item: GRINDSTONE
[CLICK] Perk ID detected: grindstone
=== Purchase Attempt ===
```

**If perk not found:**
```
[WARNING] [CLICK] No perk found for slot: X material: MATERIAL_NAME
```

## üîç Diagnostic Scenarios

### Scenario A: Nothing in Console
**Problem:** GUI not being detected
**Solutions:**
1. Check GUI title matches "Bubble" or contains special chars
2. Verify inventory size is 54
3. Check if other plugins interfering

### Scenario B: "No perk found for slot"
**Problem:** Perk IDs don't match or slot mapping wrong
**Solution:** 
Check your `perks.yml` has exact IDs:
- Slot 11: `grindstone`
- Slot 12: `workbench`
- Slot 13: `anvil`
- Slot 14: `enderchest`
- Slot 15: `cartographytable`
- Slot 16: `stonecutter`
- Slots 21-23: `homes_tier1`, `homes_tier2`, `homes_tier3`
- Slots 30-32: `vault_tier1`, `vault_tier2`, `vault_tier3`
- Slots 39-41: `job_tier1`, `job_tier2`, `job_tier3`

### Scenario C: "Decorative item, ignoring"
**Good!** That means:
- Clicks are being detected
- Decorative filtering works
- Try clicking actual perks (slots 11-16, 21-23, 30-32, 39-41)

### Scenario D: Purchase logs show but fails
Check the purchase attempt logs for:
```
[INFO] Insufficient funds: X < Y
[INFO] Player already has permission: ...
[INFO] Requirements not met for perk: ...
[WARNING] Failed to withdraw funds
```

## üí° Quick Fixes

### Fix #1: Perks Not Showing
- Check `perks.yml` syntax
- Run `/perks reload`
- Check console for "Loaded X perks"

### Fix #2: No Console Output on Click
- Verify new JAR is actually loaded (check timestamp)
- Try clicking different slots
- Check if clicking player's own inventory (bottom half) - should do nothing

### Fix #3: "Economy not available"
- Install Vault
- Install economy plugin (CoinsEngine, Essentials, etc.)
- Restart server
- Look for "Hooked into economy" on startup

### Fix #4: Permission Not Granted
- Check LuckPerms installed
- Verify commands in `perks.yml` are correct
- Check console for "Command result: false"
- Try command manually: `/lp user [name] permission set essentials.grindstone true`
