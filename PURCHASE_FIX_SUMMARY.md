# BubblePerks Purchase System - Fixes Applied

## Summary of Changes

I've completely overhauled the purchase system to make it robust, debuggable, and reliable.

---

## 🔧 Files Modified

### 1. **InventoryListener.java** - Complete Rewrite
**What Changed:**
- ✅ Fixed slot detection to work with new hardcoded GUI layout
- ✅ Added proper perk ID mapping for all slots (11-16, 21-23, 30-32, 39-41)
- ✅ Added decorative item detection (borders, separators, headers don't trigger purchases)
- ✅ Enhanced error messages with proper color codes and sounds
- ✅ Added close button functionality (slot 49)
- ✅ Added debug logging for clicked slots
- ✅ Improved purchase feedback with delayed GUI refresh for visual glow effect

**New Features:**

- Material validation
- Slot-based perk detection (no more config lookups)

---

### 2. **PerkManager.java** - Enhanced Logging
**What Changed:**
- ✅ Added comprehensive debug logging for purchase attempts
- ✅ Logs player name, perk ID, cost, and balance
- ✅ Logs permission checks
- ✅ Logs economy withdrawal status
- ✅ Logs command execution results
- ✅ Added error handling for null perks
- ✅ Better requirement validation

**Debug Output Example:**
```
=== Purchase Attempt ===
Player: Steve
Perk: grindstone
Cost: 100.0
Balance for Steve: 1000.0
Withdrew 100.0 from Steve
New balance: 900.0
Executing command: lp user Steve permission set essentials.grindstone true
Command result: true
Purchase successful!
=======================
```

### 3. **EconomyManager.java** - Robust Error Handling
**What Changed:**
- ✅ Added startup logging for economy hook
- ✅ Enhanced error messages for missing economy
- ✅ Added try-catch blocks for all economy operations
- ✅ Added debug logging for balance checks and withdrawals
- ✅ Better null checking

- ✅ Graceful fallbacks for all operations

**New Logging:**
- Economy provider detection
- Balance queries
- Withdrawal confirmations
- Transaction failures

---

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Issue #1: Slot Detection Not Working
**Problem:** The old code tried to find perks by looking up config slots, but the new GUI uses hardcoded slots.

**Solution:** Complete rewrite of `findPerkIdBySlot()` to directly map slots to perk IDs:
```java
// Utility perks: slots 11-16
if (slot >= 11 && slot <= 16) {
    String[] ids = {"grindstone", "workbench", "anvil", "enderchest", "cartographytable", "stonecutter"};
    return ids[slot - 11];
}

// Home upgrades: slots 21-23
if (slot == 21) return "homes_tier1";
if (slot == 22) return "homes_tier2";
if (slot == 23) return "homes_tier3";

// Vault upgrades: slots 30-32
if (slot == 30) return "vault_tier1";
if (slot == 31) return "vault_tier2";
if (slot == 32) return "vault_tier3";

// Job upgrades: slots 39-41
if (slot == 39) return "job_tier1";
if (slot == 40) return "job_tier2";
if (slot == 41) return "job_tier3";
```

---

### Issue #2: Decorative Items Being Clickable
**Problem:** Clicking borders, separators, or headers could cause issues.

**Solution:** Added `isDecorativeItem()` method to filter out:
- Border slots (0-8, 45-53 except functional ones)
- Separator slots (9, 18, 27, 36)
- Header slots (10, 19, 28, 37)
- Status display slots (20, 29, 38)
- Filler glass panes

---

### Issue #3: No Debug Information
**Problem:** When purchases failed, there was no way to know why.

**Solution:** Added extensive debug logging:
- Player and perk information
- Balance before and after
- Permission checks
- Command execution results
- Transaction success/failure

Enable with `debug: true` in config.yml

---

### Issue #4: Generic Error Messages
**Problem:** "Failed to purchase perk!" didn't tell you why.

**Solution:** Added specific messages:
- ✅ "You already own this perk!"
- ✅ "You need XXX 🫧 to purchase this perk!"
- ✅ "Purchase previous tier first"
- ✅ Success messages with perk names
- ✅ Sound effects for feedback

---

### Issue #5: Economy Issues Silent
**Problem:** If economy wasn't working, you'd just get generic errors.

**Solution:**
- Startup logging shows economy hook status
- Warns about missing Vault or economy provider
- Logs every balance check and withdrawal
- Shows exact amounts and transaction results

---

## 🚀 How to Use the Fixes

### Step 1: Reload/Restart
```
/perks reload
```
or restart your server.

### Step 2: Enable Debug Mode
Edit `config.yml`:
```yaml
debug: true
```

### Step 3: Test Purchase
1. Give yourself money: `/eco give [name] 1000`
2. Open GUI: `/perks`
3. Click a perk
4. Watch console for debug output

### Step 4: Check Results
You should see detailed debug output showing:
- What perk was clicked
- Your balance
- Whether money was withdrawn
- Whether commands were executed
- Success or failure reason

---

## 📋 Perk ID Requirements

**CRITICAL:** Your `perks.yml` must have these exact IDs:

### Utility Commands (Slots 11-16):
- `grindstone`
- `workbench`
- `anvil`
- `enderchest`
- `cartographytable`
- `stonecutter`

### Home Upgrades (Slots 21-23):
- `homes_tier1`
- `homes_tier2`
- `homes_tier3`

### Vault Upgrades (Slots 30-32):
- `vault_tier1`
- `vault_tier2`
- `vault_tier3`

### Job Upgrades (Slots 39-41):
- `job_tier1`
- `job_tier2`
- `job_tier3`

**If your perk IDs don't match these, purchases won't work!**

## 🔍 Debugging Steps

1. **Enable Debug Mode**
   ```yaml
   debug: true
   ```

2. **Check Console on Startup**
   Look for:
   ```
   [BubblePerks] Hooked into economy: [Name]
   [BubblePerks] Loaded X perks
   ```

3. **Test Economy**
   ```
   /balance
   /eco give [name] 1000
   ```

4. **Test Purchase**
   Open GUI and click - watch console

5. **Check Logs**
   Look for "=== Purchase Attempt ===" in console

6. **Verify Permission**
   ```
   /lp user [name] permission check [permission]
   ```

---

## ✅ Success Indicators

When working correctly, you'll see:

**Console:**
```
[INFO] === Purchase Attempt ===
[INFO] Player: YourName
[INFO] Perk: grindstone
[INFO] Cost: 100.0
[INFO] Balance for YourName: 1000.0
[INFO] Withdrew 100.0 from YourName
[INFO] New balance: 900.0
[INFO] Executing command: lp user YourName permission set essentials.grindstone true
[INFO] Command result: true
[INFO] Purchase successful!
[INFO] =======================
```

**In-Game:**
- Success message with perk name
- Level-up sound effect
- GUI refreshes
- Item shows green with glow effect
- Can now use the perk command

## 🆘 Common Issues

### "Economy not available"
- Install Vault
- Install economy plugin (CoinsEngine, Essentials, etc.)
- Check console for "Hooked into economy" message

### "Failed to purchase"
- Check balance (must be >= cost)
- Check requirements (tier 2 needs tier 1)
- Enable debug mode to see specific reason

### "No perk found for slot"
- Check perk IDs match required names
- Reload plugin after editing perks.yml

### "Command result: false"
- LuckPerms not installed
- Console doesn't have permission to run LP commands
- Command format incorrect in perks.yml

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Test with debug mode enabled
2. Verify all perk IDs match requirements
3. Test each type of perk (utility, homes, vaults, jobs)
4. Check tier progression works (must have tier 1 before tier 2)
5. Disable debug mode once everything works
