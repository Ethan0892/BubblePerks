## üõ†Ô∏è Common Issues and Fixes

### Issue 1: Economy Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- Console shows: "Economy not available when checking balance"
- Balance shows as 0 even though you have money

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Vault Installation**
   ```
   /plugins
   ```
   Make sure you see `Vault` in green.

2. **Check Economy Plugin**
   Make sure you have an economy plugin installed:
   - CoinsEngine
   - EssentialsX Economy
   - CMI Economy
   - PlayerPoints
   - etc.

3. **Verify Vault Hook**
   Look for this message in console on startup:
   ```
   [BubblePerks] Hooked into economy: [EconomyName]
   ```
   
   If you don't see this, Vault isn't finding your economy plugin.

4. **Test Economy Commands**
   ```
   /balance
   /eco give [yourname] 1000
   ```

### Issue 2: LuckPerms Not Executing Commands

**Symptoms:**
- Money is withdrawn but permission not granted
- Console shows: "Command result: false"

**Solutions:**

1. **Check LuckPerms Installation**
   ```
   /lp info
   ```

2. **Test Permission Commands Manually**
   ```
   /lp user [yourname] permission set essentials.grindstone true
   ```

3. **Verify Command Format in perks.yml**
   Check each perk has proper commands:
   ```yaml
   grindstone:
     commands:
       - 'lp user {player} permission set essentials.grindstone true'
   ```

4. **Check Console Permissions**
   The console must have permission to run LuckPerms commands.

---

### Issue 3: Perk Already Owned (But You Don't Have It)

**Symptoms:**
- Says you already own a perk
- But you can't use the command

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Your Permissions**
   ```
   /lp user [yourname] permission check essentials.grindstone
   ```

2. **Clear the Permission if Needed**
   ```
   /lp user [yourname] permission unset essentials.grindstone
   ```

3. **Try Purchasing Again**

---

### Issue 4: Clicking Does Nothing

**Symptoms:**
- No error message
- No purchase happens
- Nothing in console

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Slot Mapping**
   The new GUI uses hardcoded slots:
   - Slots 11-16: Utility commands
   - Slots 21-23: Home upgrades
   - Slots 30-32: Vault upgrades
   - Slots 39-41: Job upgrades

2. **Check Perk IDs Match**
   In `perks.yml`, make sure your perk IDs match:
   ```yaml
   perks:
     grindstone:      # Must be "grindstone"
     workbench:       # Must be "workbench"
     anvil:           # Must be "anvil"
     enderchest:      # Must be "enderchest"
     cartographytable: # Must be "cartographytable"
     stonecutter:     # Must be "stonecutter"
     homes_tier1:     # Must be "homes_tier1"
     homes_tier2:     # Must be "homes_tier2"
     homes_tier3:     # Must be "homes_tier3"
     vault_tier1:     # Must be "vault_tier1"
     vault_tier2:     # Must be "vault_tier2"
     vault_tier3:     # Must be "vault_tier3"
     job_tier1:       # Must be "job_tier1"
     job_tier2:       # Must be "job_tier2"
     job_tier3:       # Must be "job_tier3"
   ```

3. **Reload the Plugin**
   ```
   /perks reload
   ```

---

### Issue 5: Requirements Not Met

**Symptoms:**
- Console shows: "Requirements not met for perk: X"
- Tier upgrades are locked

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Tier Requirements**
   For tier upgrades, you must have the previous tier:
   ```yaml
   homes_tier2:
     requirements:
       permission: 'essentials.sethome.multiple.tier1'  # Must have tier 1
   ```

2. **Grant Previous Tier First**
   ```
   /lp user [yourname] permission set essentials.sethome.multiple.tier1 true
   ```

## üí° Advanced Debugging

### Check Actual Item Clicked:
Look for this in console when debug is on:
```
[INFO] No perk found for slot: X material: MATERIAL_NAME
```

This tells you:
- Which slot you clicked (X)
- What material was in that slot

### Verify Perk Configuration:
```
/perks reload
```
Console should show:
```
[INFO] Loaded X perks
```

If it shows 0, your perks.yml has syntax errors.

### Test Perk Detection:
Enable debug mode and click each slot. You should see either:
- A purchase attempt message
- "No perk found for slot: X"
